# Project Template

`cp -r skeleton projectname`

`git clone ssh://keeperofthevalley//srv/git/PROJECTNAME.git www`

`npm install`

`vim util/config.js`
_Update the local and remote directories as neccesary_


## IN PROGRESS:

I am working on making this universal. The skeleton will be stored in a github project. I will make a shell command to pull down the repo and run the init script(s). This will prompt for the project name, repo address, etc. and pull down the project repo into the www directory.
